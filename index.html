<h3>About LED</h3>

<p>After three years of discussion and early prototypes, the <a href="http://www.umweltbundesamt.de/">Federal Environment Agency (UBA)</a>, Germany, now has launched a two-year research & development project on Linked Environment Data (LED) with <a href="http://www.innoq.com/en">innoQ Deutschland GmbH</a> as a contractor. This project will set up a core cloud of environment data with a well-elaborated domain terminology as its semantic backbone. Data will be taken from the "Environmental Specimen Bank", the "German Metadata Portal on Soil" and further databases such as the environmental library and research databases. The infrastructure will support a sustainable process of keeping the data permanently up-to-date, and there will be a dynamic and intuitive user interface. All the work will be fully Semantic Web compliant, based on vocabularies such as <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/">SKOS</a>, <a href="http://semanticweb.org/wiki/Scovo">SCOVO</a> or <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/">Data Cubes</a>, and <a href="http://dublincore.org">Dublin Core</a>.</p>

<h3>EnviroInfo 2012</h3>

<p>Thomas Bandholtz, Søren Michael Roug and Joachim Hübener will chair three sessions on "Linking Open Data about the Environment" at the <a href="http://www.enviroinfo2012.org/">EnviroInfo</a> end of August 2012.
